[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Stropek/popular-movies.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Stropek/popular-movies)

This is my solution to _Popular Movies - stage 1_ project from __Android Developer Nanodegree Program__

### Movies Database API Key

For application to work with __Movies Database API__ you'll need to add _`keys.properties`_ file in 
project's main directory. The file should contain values listed below:

```
DEBUG.MOVIE_DATABASE_API_KEY = "{DEBUG_KEY}"
RELEASE.MOVIE_DATABASE_API_KEY = "{RELEASE_KEY}"
```
